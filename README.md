# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Fineace
Fineace is a comprehensive web application built with React, leveraging modern tools like Vite for rapid development, Tailwind CSS for scalable styling, and Hardhat for managing and deploying smart contracts. The project seamlessly integrates blockchain functionalities, making it a perfect fit for decentralized applications.

Key Features
Frontend
Vite: Ensures fast development and optimized builds with hot module replacement (HMR) capabilities.
React: A component-based frontend library providing an interactive user interface.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for custom design and layout.
React Hook Form: Handles complex forms, including validation, easily and efficiently.
Web3 & Blockchain Integration
RainbowKit: Streamlines the wallet connection process, offering users an intuitive way to link their cryptocurrency wallets.
wagmi: Provides hooks for Ethereum development, including Web3 interactions like signing transactions or querying blockchain data.
WalletConnect: Supports multiple wallet integrations, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.
Backend & Smart Contracts
Hardhat: A powerful Ethereum development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
Ignition: Simplifies contract deployment with automated configurations.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version >=14.0.0)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Yunusabdul38/fineace.git
cd fineace
Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:



npm install
Running the App
To start the development server, execute:


npm run dev
This will run the application locally on http://localhost:3000.

To create a production build:


npm run build
For a preview of the build:


npm run preview
Linting
For code linting, the project uses ESLint with additional configurations for React and hooks. You can check and fix linting errors using:

npm run lint
Smart Contract Management
This project includes smart contracts written in Solidity. Hardhat is used to compile, deploy, and test the contracts.

Key Commands
Compile smart contracts:

npx hardhat compile
Run tests for contracts:

npx hardhat test
To generate gas reports while running tests:


REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
Run a local Ethereum node:

npx hardhat node
Deploy contracts using Ignition:

npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
